        'Gleams that untravell\'d world whose margin fades\n'
        'For ever and forever when I move.\n'
        'How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\n'
        'To rust unburnish\'d, not to shine in use!\n'
        'As tho\' to breathe were life! Life piled on life\n'
        'Were all too little, and of one to me\n'
        'Little remains: but every hour is saved\n'

        'Subdue them to the useful and the good.\n'
        'Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere\n'
        'Of common duties, decent not to fail\n'
        'In offices of tenderness, and pay\n'

        'Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;\n'

        'Some work of noble note, may yet be done,\n'

        'The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep\n'
        'Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,\n'
        '\'T is not too late to seek a newer world.\n'
        'Push off, and sitting well in order smite\n'
        'The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\n'
        'To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n'
        'Of all the western stars, until I die.\n'
        'It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:\n'
        'It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\n'
        'And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\n'
        'Tho\' much is taken, much abides; and tho\'\n'
        'We are not now that strength which in old days\n'
        'Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;\n'
        'One equal temper of heroic hearts,\n'
        'Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will\n'
        'To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'
